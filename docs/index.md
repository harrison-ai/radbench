# RadBench: Radiology Benchmark Framework


## Overview

RadBench is a radiology benchmark framework developed by [Harrison.ai](https://harrison.ai/). It is designed to evaluate the performance of Harrison.ai's foundational radiology model, `harrison.rad.1`, against other competitive models in the field. The framework employs a rigorous evaluation methodology across three distinct datasets to ensure the models are thoroughly assessed for clinical relevance, accuracy, and case comprehension. These datasets are:

1. [**RadBench Dataset**](/datasets/radbench): A new visual question-answering dataset designed by Harrison.ai to benchmark radiology models.
   
2. [**VQA-RAD Dataset**](/datasets/vqa-rad): A visual question-answering dataset for radiology, available at [Nature Datasets](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018251).
   
3. [**Fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists (FRCR) 2B Examination**](/datasets/frcr): Curated for the Fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists (FRCR) Rapids 2B exam, obtained from third parties to ensure fairness in our evaluation process.
