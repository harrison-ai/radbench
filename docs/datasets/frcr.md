# FRCR

Medical specialists undertake rigorous and thorough evaluation examinations before practicing Radiology. The Fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists (FRCR) is one such examination. We used a component of this examination, the FRCR 2B Rapids [@FRCR2B], to benchmark radiology foundation models.

While the actual examinations are kept confidential to prevent leakage, mock FRCR examinations are available on various established educational websites. Our FRCR evaluation dataset is comprised of 70 FRCR examination sheets procured from these established third party organisations. We have sourced this dataset from third party to ensure fairness in our evaluation process.
